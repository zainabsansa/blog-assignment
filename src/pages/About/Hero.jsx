        Starter is a ‚Äústarter‚Äù theme designed for simplicity and minimalism. It
        is particularly suitable for personal blogs. It is designed by <a href="#">nrk9819</a>.

        I plan to implement this theme in a variety of site generators and
        content management systems. My first priorities are enhance, 11ty, astro
        and ghost (CMS). In the future, there will also be Hugo, Solidstart,
        Hono, Deno Fresh, Vitepress and SvelteKit versions. Codes for every
        implementation will be available on my github.
