            Starter is a ‚Äústarter‚Äù theme designed for simplicity and minimalism.
            It is particularly suitable for personal blogs. It is designed by <a href="#">nrk9819</a>. The figma design file available to <a className="download" href="#">download for free</a>ü§© under <a href="#">CC BY 4.4</a>

            I plan to implement this theme in a variety of site generators and
            content management systems. My first priorities are enhance, 11ty,
            astro and ghost (CMS). In the future, there will also be Hugo,
            Solidstart, Hono, Deno Fresh, Vitepress and SvelteKit versions.
            Codes for every implementation will be available on my github.
